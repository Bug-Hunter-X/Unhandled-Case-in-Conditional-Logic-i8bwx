This repository contains a MATLAB function with a subtle bug related to unhandled cases in conditional logic. The function `myFunction` aims to perform different calculations based on the input value 'x'.  However, it fails to explicitly handle the case when 'x' is exactly 10. The bug and its solution are provided in separate MATLAB files. The solution adds a specific condition to handle the missing case of x=10.
